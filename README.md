# magento2-prerender-io
Provides integration between Magento 2 and [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io), giving the ability for pages to be automatically recached when required.

## ATTENTION ##
Development on this module has been moved to a more generalised fork (https://github.com/aligent/magento2-prerender), removing the hard dependency on prerender.io, and instead utilising a configurable prerender service URL.

## Overview
This module provides new indexers:

- `prerender_io_product`, which will send URL recache requests for products to Prerender.io (in batches of up to 1000) when changes are made to products.
- `prerender_io_category`, which will send URL recache requests for categories to Prerender.io (in batches of up to 1000) when changes are made to categories.
- `prerender_io_category_product`, which will send URL recache requests for categories to Prerender.io (in batches of up to 1000) when changes are made to products.

These will ensure that the cached pages are kept up-to-date at all times.

## Installation
To install via composer, simply run:

```bash
composer require aligent/magento2-prerender-io
```

Then, ensure the module is installed and the indexers are set to `Schedule`:

```bash
bin/magento module:enable Aligent_PrerenderIo
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento indexer:set-mode schedule prerender_io_product prerender_io_category prerender_io_category_product
```

## Configuration
The extension can be configured via `Stores -> Configuration -> System -> Prerender.io`
